Magellan is a mockup developed at HackUPC 2024 for the challenge proposed by Travelperk. It is a social media application that enhances users' experiences while traveling around the world by proposing different challenges for certain landmarks in a city.

It also computes travel plans to help people coincide at certain places and informs users about nearby people, providing a platform to meet new people.
