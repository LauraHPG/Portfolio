The first one prompted the user with a word related to the destination of the flight, and with that, the user had to had to write a sentence.\n2. The sentences were sent to random players, and each of them had to draw the sentence received.\n3. Finally, all the sentences with the corresponding drawings were shown to everybody.\n\nThe main challenges were the new technologies used by every member of the group. Marc had to learn how to work with the html canvas, Pere had to learn how to connect the different endpoints via bluetooth (host-players), and finally myself, where I had to implement the Django server where the information would be sent and received.\n";
