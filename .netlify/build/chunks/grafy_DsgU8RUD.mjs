I also have a big passion for graphs and how they can visually represent data and relationships. So, after finishing my bachelor’s thesis, I decided to combine these interests into a project.\n\nGrafy is a web app that helps you discover new artists in a fun, interactive and visual way. I’ve built it using React, a technology that I've been wanting to learn for a long time. For the visualizations, I chose VisJs, thanks to the experience I gained from my thesis. The app pulls data from the Spotify API, which offers a lot of cool features.\n\nGrafy is still a work in progress, but if you're interested in being a tester, I’d love to hear from you! Just drop me a message with the email linked to your Spotify account.\n";
